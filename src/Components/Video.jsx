    <h1>Wanted</h1>
    <p>This movie is sadly underrated. Do yourself a favor, just watch it & form your own opinion.
       Don't believe anyone who praises it as a masterpiece & DEFINITELY don't listen to anyone who calls
        it garbage (or even just bad). This film is actually packed to the brim with cool concepts, 
        stunning locals & compelling characters. It does suffer on the narrative side however & not 
        all the characters are worth their time on screen. Also the dialog could've used some more work.
         But if you can deal with that, Mortal Engines actually creates a fascinating world full of as many
          bright sights as it has grim realities. In fact the way it strikes this balance is easily one of
           its strongest traits.</p>

    <h1>Monkey King </h1>
    <p>Best movie in Expendables series so far. This time casting is huge including new young actors who fight side-by-side with veterans. 
Story involves a renegade ex-expendable member Stonebanks going against expendables team. First, expendables rescue former member Doctor death from prison train & then discover arms trader is Stonebanks who was considered dead. Expendables team engage in battle, recruit new members to save old, captures Stonebanks, en-route getting captured & finally getting saved by old team with some help from friends, killing Stonebanks & army. 
Overall, it's huge action packed movie with lots of tanks & gun fire show. Fully entertaining, solid casting, good story & action sequences. I would rate it 4/5.</p>

      <h1>Morbius</h1>
      <p>This is a GREAT Family film, a nice end to Summer. If you Like the character and his interpretations 
        throughout the different TV shows you'll LOVE him here. The Story acts as a SOLID introduction to the
         character but having known the Scarabs REACH background from the comics i would have liked for it to
         be addressed more in the movie, however they do clarify its an alien which is fine but a minor gripe.
